Analyze the following JSON log message for indicators of compromise, types of attacks, and any suspicious activity:

{{ JSON.stringify($json.message) }}

Your output should include:

2. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Extract and list IPs, URLs, user agents, usernames, file hashes, or any suspicious elements.
3. Tactics and Techniques (based on MITRE ATT&CK if possible).
4. Severity Assessment: Rate the severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical) with a brief justification.
5. Security Recommendations: Provide actionable steps or mitigations.
6. Incident Handling Notes: What an analyst should focus on next.
7. Get the whois record from the tools and include it in report.
8. Get details of the ip and domain from virustotal and include the inference in the output report.
9. Give the report in a subjective redable format.

You can connect to various tools to fetch the information realted to ip domain etc. The tools that are available are virustotal api and whois api.
Only include findings relevant to cybersecurity. If nothing suspicious is found, clearly state that.
